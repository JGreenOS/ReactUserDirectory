# Overview

This is an employee directory using React, using components, managing component state and responding to a user event. 

## User Story

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by age as I am a health insurance manager and need to know which employees are exempt. 

### Acceptance Criteria 

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by Last Name.

  * Filter the users by age. In this example, users are filtered for age (over 33 and under 33). While the current age for health insurance by an employer is 26, the test data does not have enough users under the age of 26.
